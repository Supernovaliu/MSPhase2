Summary
Model Selection and Configuration: A RandomForestRegressor was selected for its robustness in handling both linear and non-linear relationships and its suitability for mixed data types. This model also offers interpretable outputs through feature importance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV to systematically explore various hyperparameters, including the number of trees (n_estimators), tree depth (max_depth), and the minimum samples for splits and leaves. This approach ensured the identification of optimal settings for the model, enhancing its performance.
Training and Evaluation: The model was rigorously trained using the optimal parameters. Performance on an independent test set was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²), essential for assessing predictive accuracy and the variance explained by the model.
Results from the Evaluation: The RandomForestRegressor showed excellent capability on the training set, achieving an R² score of 0.95, indicating a high level of variance explanation. However, the performance on the test dataset showed an R² of 0.64 and a higher MSE, suggesting potential overfitting to the training data.
