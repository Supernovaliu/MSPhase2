
Summary
Here are the steps taken to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing:

Data Understanding and Visualization: Identified and visualized numerical and categorical data, revealing key distributions and outlier presence.
Data Conversion: Transformed categorical data into numerical formats using one-hot encoding to facilitate machine learning modeling.
Outlier Management: Identified and removed outliers in Sales and Profit to normalize their distributions.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed correlations to understand dependencies between variables, which is crucial for feature selection and modeling.

Findings:
The significant impact of discounts on profits and their negative correlation highlights an area for strategic business analysis.
Outlier management helped in stabilizing feature scales, making the dataset more uniform and potentially improving model performance.
